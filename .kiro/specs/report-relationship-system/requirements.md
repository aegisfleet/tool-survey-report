# Requirements Document

## Introduction

レポート間の関係性をフロントマターで管理し、相互参照リンクを自動生成するシステムを構築します。これにより、関連するツールやサービス間の関係性を明確にし、Wikiのような相互参照機能を実現します。

## Glossary

- **Report System**: 既存の_reportsディレクトリ内のMarkdownファイル群を指すシステム
- **Relationship Metadata**: フロントマターに記述される関係性情報
- **Cross-Reference Links**: レポート間の相互参照リンク
- **Parent-Child Relationship**: 親子関係（例：GitHub - GitHub Actions）
- **Sibling Relationship**: 兄弟関係（例：Cursor - Kiro - VSCode）
- **Jekyll Site**: 既存のJekyllベースの静的サイト生成システム

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to define relationships between reports using front matter, so that I can organize tools and services by their connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report file is created or updated, THE Report System SHALL support relationship metadata in the front matter
2. THE Report System SHALL support parent-child relationships through "parent" and "children" fields
3. THE Report System SHALL support sibling relationships through "related_tools" field
4. THE Report System SHALL validate relationship metadata syntax and warn about invalid references
5. WHERE relationship fields are defined, THE Report System SHALL ensure bidirectional consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to see related reports automatically linked on each page, so that I can easily navigate between connected tools and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a report page, THE Jekyll Site SHALL display a "Related Tools" section
2. THE Jekyll Site SHALL show parent tools with clear hierarchical indication
3. THE Jekyll Site SHALL show child tools with clear hierarchical indication  
4. THE Jekyll Site SHALL show sibling tools in a grouped format
5. THE Jekyll Site SHALL generate clickable links to all related reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to automatically maintain bidirectional relationships, so that when I define a parent-child relationship in one file, the reverse relationship is automatically recognized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report defines another report as its parent, THE Report System SHALL automatically recognize the child relationship
2. WHEN a report lists children, THE Report System SHALL automatically recognize those as having the report as parent
3. THE Report System SHALL detect and warn about inconsistent relationship definitions
4. THE Report System SHALL provide validation tools to check relationship integrity
5. WHERE relationship conflicts exist, THE Report System SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement this system with minimal changes to existing reports, so that the current content structure is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Report System SHALL work with existing front matter structure without breaking changes
2. THE Report System SHALL be backward compatible with reports that don't have relationship metadata
3. THE Report System SHALL use optional front matter fields that don't affect existing functionality
4. THE Report System SHALL integrate with the existing Jekyll build process
5. THE Report System SHALL maintain existing URL structure and navigation
